    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      ElixirRegex.com was initially created for the Phoenix Phrenzy
      contest to showcase Phoenix LiveView. It was something that I
      had wanted to make for a while anyway, so this seemed like a
      perfect time with the perfect technology to create it.
      Hopefully you find it useful! I know I'll be using it regularly.

          and lives in Franklin, TN. When he's not creating sparkling UI
          interfaces, you'll probably find him at one of the many BBQ

          all off). Also occasionally tweeting at
